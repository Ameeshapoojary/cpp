Rule 1:const keyword is applied to the 'token' on its immediate left .
If there is nothing to its left,const is applied to the token on immediate right.

Rule 2:while working with pointers,treat * symbol
as a token too!
const int * ptr;
-->int is separate token
-->* is a separate token
const int * ptr;
-->this is constant integer

int const * ptr=&n1;-->this is correct
-->const cannot be applied for *


//in java we use final instead of const

const -can be taken from the user 
-->and use it 
-->and cannot modify it

=>obj on stack-->()
=>obj on 

=>Marking a function const-->
==> Obj passed a const-->can only call member functionwhich is also 
marked as const
